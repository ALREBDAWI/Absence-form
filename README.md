>> The main purpose of this project is to practice and explore :

  - Validating forms and handling input in a dynamic manner
  - Using sessionStorage to pass data between pages
  - DOM manipulation and event handling
  - Simple UX/UI design with a focus on usability


>> What it does :

  - Let users fill a form to request an absence (one day or multiple days)
  - Fields are shown or hidden in a dynamic manner based on the absence type
  - Input validation both live and on submit
  - Show the submitted data in a read-only summary page
  - Print result


>> Possible future developments :

  - Canvas signature instead of text input
  - PDF export
  - Responsive design
  - Enhanced UX/UI
